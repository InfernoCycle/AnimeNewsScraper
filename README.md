Export wizard allows a user to export news "by article" (the selected article is shown in the textbox) or "by month". When choosing "by month" all news for that month (even if it's not available for individual selection) will be exported into a single file with the month and year name on it.

# Notes
News will only be loaded upon opening the app for the day you opened it.

# News Source
All news comes straight from [Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/)
