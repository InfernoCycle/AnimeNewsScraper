You can export news data by the month chosen or by the article that is currently selected. When choosing "by month" anime news data that is not available in the regular selector will be exported as well. This is not a bug, this is due to the incompleteness of the project and will be fixed in later versions.

# Notes
News will only be loaded upon opening the app and on the day you opened it.
